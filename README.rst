Info
====
A simple infinity mirror project.  Originally, the mirror was inside a pumpkin!
Now it resides in the wooden clock box that the bezel/glass came from, and runs
off one of my computer's USB ports.

Notes
=====
Code is a Webbotlib project (.prj file) that is built with WinAVR (e.g. AVR Studio 4).

You will need to use the .prj file in Project Designer to generate the various
Webbotlib files needed to actually compile the code...

Needs Webbotlib 2.11+.
